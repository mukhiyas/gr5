## üö® Advanced Risk Assessment Engine

### **Multi-Factor Risk Scoring (6 Dimensions)**
1. **Base Risk Score**: Event category severity (0-100 scale)
2. **Sub-Category Multipliers**: 
   - Conviction (1.8x), Sanctions (1.9x), Indictment (1.6x)
   - Acquitted (0.3x), Dismissed (0.4x) - reduced risk
3. **Temporal Weighting**: Recent events score higher
   - Last 12 months: 1.5x multiplier
   - Last 5 years: 1.2x multiplier
   - Over 10 years: 0.7x multiplier
4. **Geographic Risk Factors**: Country-based adjustments
   - High-risk: Afghanistan (1.4x), Iran (1.4x), North Korea (1.5x)
   - Low-risk: Switzerland (0.9x), Denmark (0.9x), Norway (0.9x)
5. **Relationship Risk Propagation**: Connected entity risk influence
   - 8% increase per high-risk relationship (capped at 50%)
6. **PEP Status Adjustments**: Political exposure multipliers
   - High-level PEP (HOS, CAB): 1.3x multiplier
   - Lower-level PEP (MUN, FAM): 1.15x multiplier

### **4-Tier Risk Classification**
- **Critical (80-120)**: Terrorism, sanctions, money laundering
- **Valuable (60-79)**: Fraud, corruption, cybercrime
- **Investigative (40-59)**: Regulatory violations, environmental crimes
