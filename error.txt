-- Check the structure and content of the code_dictionary table
  SELECT
      code_type,
      COUNT(*) as code_count,
      COLLECT_SET(code) as sample_codes
  FROM prd_bronze_catalog.grid.code_dictionary
  GROUP BY code_type
  ORDER BY code_count DESC;

  And this one to see specific event category codes:

  -- Get all event category codes and descriptions
  SELECT
      code,
      code_description,
      code_type
  FROM prd_bronze_catalog.grid.code_dictionary
  WHERE code_type = 'event_category'
  ORDER BY code;

  And for PEP/attribute codes:

  -- Get all PEP/attribute codes
  SELECT
      code,
      code_description,
      code_type
  FROM prd_bronze_catalog.grid.code_dictionary
  WHERE code_type IN ('entity_attribute', 'pep_level', 'pep_type')
  ORDER BY code_type, code;
