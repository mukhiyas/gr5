Complete Clustering Analysis Categories:

  1. Risk Code Clusters

  - Analyzes risk codes and their distribution
  - Shows entity count, event count, severity levels
  - Identifies critical, valuable, investigative, and probative risks

  2. PEP Level Clusters

  - Analyzes Politically Exposed Person categories
  - Categories: HOS (Head of State), CAB (Cabinet), MUN (Municipal), LEG (Legislative), FAM (Family), ASC (Associate)
  - Shows distribution across different PEP risk levels

  3. Geographic Clusters

  - Country and city-based distribution analysis
  - Shows geographic concentration of entities
  - Identifies high-risk jurisdictions and regions

  4. Source System Clusters

  - Analyzes data sources and their coverage
  - Shows which databases/systems contribute most entities
  - Tracks data quality and completeness by source

  5. Event Subcategory Clusters

  - Analyzes event types and patterns
  - Categories like sanctions (SAN), enforcement (ENF), regulatory (REG)
  - Shows event frequency and impact patterns

  6. Temporal Clusters

  - Time-based analysis of events and entity activities
  - Shows trends over years and time periods
  - Identifies recent vs historical risk patterns

  7. Attribute Type Clusters

  - Analyzes entity attributes (PTY, PRT, URL, RMK, SEX)
  - Shows data completeness and attribute distributions
  - Tracks entity characteristic patterns

  ðŸ“Š Additional Analysis Features:

  - Risk Severity Distribution: Critical/Valuable/Investigative/Probative breakdown
  - Summary Statistics: Total counts across all cluster types
  - Sample Entities: Representative examples for each cluster
  - Smart Insights: AI-generated analysis of patterns and risks

  ðŸŽ¯ Business Value:

  The clustering analysis provides enterprise-grade business intelligence for:
  - Risk Assessment: Identifying concentration risks and patterns
  - Compliance Monitoring: PEP exposure and regulatory requirements
  - Geographic Risk: Jurisdictional and sanctions compliance
  - Data Quality: Source coverage and completeness analysis
  - Trend Analysis: Temporal patterns and emerging risks
  - Strategic Planning: Resource allocation and risk mitigation

  This is a comprehensive analytical engine that goes far beyond simple individual/PEP analysis to provide full 360-degree risk intelligence.
